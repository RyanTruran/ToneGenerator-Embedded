# Tone Generator-Embedded

Tone Generator-Embedded is a barebones program for a TIVA TI123GXL Board.  The application was created to merge 2 projects which i completed from an edX course that utilize sound generation and UART.

The user Interface for this project is  **[ToneGenerator](https://github.com/RyanTruran/ToneGenerator)**. 


## Getting Started

To get started simply clone this repository, 
```git clone https://github.com/RyanTruran/ToneGenerator-Embedded.git```
To build this application Keil μVision 4.74.0 is required. 

Once downloaded, you will need to rebuild all code, then load it to the μController.

Issue a reset from the controller to ensure all required ports are open, before attempting to communicate form **ToneGenerator**
